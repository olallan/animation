	abstract = {We examined college instructors’ perceptions of student use of mobile technology for off-task purposes during class. Previous research demonstrated that digital distraction hinders student learning, yet little is known about instructor views and reactions to this behavior. Phenomenological interviews with 11 college instructors revealed that student digital distraction has a profound influence on their pedagogical decision-making, relationships with students, and professional satisfaction. These instructors regularly encounter student digital distraction during class and have well-defined views on the deleterious influence digital distraction has on the integrity of the classroom learning environment. However, instructors were divided in their perceived responsibility to curb this behavior. Most rely on proactive prevention strategies rather than reactive strategies out of concern for negatively impacting student-instructor rapport. Moreover, these instructors experience frustration stemming from student digital distraction. Findings indicate that student digital distraction influences pedagogical decision-making and threatens the quality of student-instructor rapport.},

	abstract = {Higher education learning is increasingly enacted in digital environments and doctoral education is no exception. Scholars – supervisors and {PhD} candidates – actively create their own digital profiles, and their research is often disseminated via social media in tandem with the traditional publication of journals and books. Online learning behaviours, social media and doctoral education are complex, and, when considered together, present distinct challenges. This paper explores the work and practices of digital academics using social media through a case study of an academic blog, {DoctoralWriting}. We use statistical data from the blog to map evolving pedagogic practices and forms of doctoral writing support and engagement. This analysis reveals horizontalised networks of co-creating consumers and producers who interact on social media platforms in ways that signal new transnational networks of learning and teaching. This paper contributes to our understanding of academic engagement with social media in contemporary doctoral education, particularly doctoral writing.},

	shorttitle = {{AQ}-Routing},
	abstract = {Internet of Things, is an innovative technology which allows the connection of physical things with the digital world through the use of heterogeneous networks and communication technologies. In an {IoT} system, a major role is played by the wireless sensor network as its components comprise: sensing, data acquiring, heterogeneous connectivity and data processing. Mobile ad-hoc networks are highly self reconfiguring networks of mobile nodes which communicate through wireless links. In such a network, each node acts both as a router and host at the same time. The interaction between {MANETs} and Internet of Things opens new ways for service provision in smart environments and challenging issues in its networking aspects. One of the main issues in {MANET}–{IoT} systems is the mobility of the network nodes: routing protocol must react effectively to the topological changes into the algorithm design. We describe the design and implementation of {AQ}-Routing, and analyze its performance using both simulations and measurements based on our implementation. In general, the networking of such a system is very challenging regarding routing aspects. Also, it is related to system mobility and limited network sensor resources. This article builds upon this observation an adaptive routing protocol ({AQ}-Routing) based on Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) techniques, which has the ability to detect the level of mobility at different points of time so that each individual node can update routing metric accordingly. The proposed protocol introduces: (i) new model, developed via Q-learning technique, to detect the level of mobility at each node in the network; (ii) a new metric, called \$\$Q\_\{{\textbackslash}textit\{metric\}\},\$\$Qmetric, which account for the static and dynamic routing metrics, and which are combined and updated to the changing network topologies. The protocol can efficiently handle network mobility by a way of preemptively adapting its behaviour thanks to the mobility detection model. The presented results of simulation provide an effective approach to improve the stability of links in both static and mobile scenario and, hence, increase the packet delivery ratio in the global {MANET}–{IoT} system.},
